## Instructor: [Rem Zolotykh][instructor url]


In this course we’ll build our own simple MVC framework on top of Rack. Though the final product naturally won’t be as full-featured as, for example, Ruby on Rails, the journey is what counts! Let’s learn how it’s done.

### Usage

1) bundle install  
2) rackup config.ru  
3) Go to `http://127.0.0.1:9292/`
